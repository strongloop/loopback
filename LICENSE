      of this Agreement, provided further that Customer shall be liable for any
      failure by such employees and third-party contractors to comply with the
      terms of this Agreement and no usage restrictions, if any, shall be
      exceeded; or

      software or services to circumvent or provide access, permissions or
      rights which violate the license keys embedded within the Software; or

processes, technical data, engineering, techniques, methodologies and concepts

employees and contractors having a need to know such Confidential Information
and shall take all reasonable precautions to ensure that such employees and
contractors comply with the provisions of this Section.  The obligations of
Customer under this Section shall not apply to information that Customer can
demonstrate (i) was in its possession at the time of disclosure and without
restriction as to confidentiality, (ii) at the time of disclosure is generally
available to the public or after disclosure becomes generally available to the
public through no breach of agreement or other wrongful act by Customer, (iii)
has been received from a third party without restriction on disclosure and
without breach of agreement by Customer, or (iv) is independently developed by
Customer without regard to the Confidential Information.  In addition, Customer
may disclose Confidential Information as required to comply with binding orders
of governmental entities that have jurisdiction over it; provided that Customer
gives StrongLoop reasonable written notice to allow StrongLoop to seek a
protective order or other appropriate remedy, discloses only such Confidential
Information as is required by the governmental entity, and uses commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain confidential treatment for any Confidential
Information disclosed.  Notwithstanding the above, Customer agrees that
StrongLoop, its employees and agents shall be free to use and employ their
general skills, know-how, and expertise, and to use, disclose, and employ any

amounts from any payments to StrongLoop under this Agreement, (a) Customer shall
effect such withholding, remit such amounts to the appropriate taxing
authorities and promptly furnish StrongLoop with tax receipts evidencing the
payments of such amounts and (b) the sum payable by Customer upon which the
deduction or withholding is based shall be increased to the extent necessary to

equal to the amount StrongLoop would have received and retained absent the
required deduction or withholding.
