 - '/weapons?filter[where][name]=M1911': Weapons with name M1911
 - '/weapons?filter[where][audibleRange][lt]=10': Weapons with audioRange < 10
 - '/weapons?filter[fields][name]=1&filter[fields][effectiveRange]=1': Only name and effective ranges
 - '/weapons?filter[where][effectiveRange][gt]=900&filter[limit]=3': The top 3 weapons with a range over 900 meters
 - '/weapons?filter[order]=audibleRange%20DESC&filter[limit]=3': The loudest 3 weapons

 - '/locations': Locations
 - '/locations?filter[where][geo][near]=153.536,-28.1&filter[limit]=3': The 3 closest locations to a given geo point


###Example
