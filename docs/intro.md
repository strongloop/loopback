# LoopBack

LoopBack, part of the StrongLoop Suite, a mobile backend framework that can run in the cloud or on your own servers.
It is built on [StrongNode](http://strongloop.com/strongloop-suite/strongnode/) and open-source Node.js modules, so
it is highly extensible and familiar to developers already using Node.

For more information on the advantages of using LoopBack, see 
[StrongLoop / LoopBack](http://strongloop.com/strongloop-suite/loopback/).
