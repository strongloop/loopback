LoopBack is a mobile backend framework that puts you in control.  As
a mobile developer you decide where to run your mobile backend - in
the cloud or on-premise.
LoopBack is built on [StrongNode](/strongnode) and open source Node.js
modules. It leverages the power of Node, the community that
stands behind Node, and the support that [StrongLoop](www.strongloop.com)
offers.

LoopBack is here to help you develop mobile applications with rich
functionality and data that is in your datacenter and the cloud.
Since LoopBack is built on open source, it is highly extensible and
familiar with developers already using Node.
Node.js leverages Javascript.  The ubiquituous language of the web
that most developers have already had familiarity with it's ease of
use.
